Assumptions about prior knowledge have been made accordingly.*\n\nPreviously, you have worked with the premise that earthquakes emit 'rays' of seismic signal, that travel along an infinitesimally narrow path from source to receiver. This *ray theory* stems from geometric optics, and has been an incredibly successful tool in determining the Earth's structure already in the early 20th century.\n\n![darkside](img/pinkfloyd.png)\n\nHowever, just like light, seismic energy propagates at many different wavelengths. Ray theory basically gets rid of all the *wave* aspects of seismic wave propagation. This simplification cannot reproduce all effects that we observe.\n\nThe main issue with this simplification is its inability to account for certain wave-like behaviour (e.g. diffraction, scattering) and effects like _dispersion_ (which lies a the base of the prism's effect in the image above), wave interference and so-called \"wavefront healing\".\n\n*The above image is from the Pink Floyd album \"Dark side of the moon\"*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## This practical\n\nIn this practical, you will **explore the wave nature of seismic wave propagation**, as well as why this is relevant, and how we can use it in seismic imaging. You will do this by **running simulations of seismic wave propagation**. Note that this is computationally expensive for real-world applications but we have scaled this down for you. \n\n1. **First**, you will get familiar with the setup in which all the simulations in this practical will take place, and prepare all the necessary information to turn this setting into something the computer can run simulations with.\n1. **Second**, you will simulate seismic waves propagating through this setup and analyse what is happening. You will become familiar with the interplay between source-receiver configuration, the seismic wavefield and reflections.\n1. **Third**, you will learn about the relationships between seismic velocity, signal frequency and the ray approximation. For this, you will look at _Fresnel zones_ and compute so-called _sensitivity kernels_. You will look at how this sensitivity varies for different parts of the seismogram and analyse how they highlight different properties and/or parts of the model.\n\nAt the end, **you should be able to answer the following questions**:\n\n* What are the main assumptions of ray theory? And where does this assumption break down?\n* What do we mean by  'sensitivity kernels', and how do they relate to ray paths?\n* What information is stored in a seismogram about different parts of our domain?\n* Under what circumstances do the assumptions of ray theory hold best?\n* What is the influence of frequency on sensitivity to a model?\n\nIn this practical you will do exercises and answer questions, all of which are supplied and can be carried out in this _Jupyter notebook_.

This is done by selecting a specific window of interest from the seismogram. First of all, we will look at the direct P-wave arrival. Based on the wave propagation you ran, you should know which arrival this is on your seismogram.\n\nOnce we've decided which measurement we are focusing on, we can start computing sensitivity kernels. We do this by first calculating the adjoint source for the part of the seismogram that we're interested in.\n\n* **Task**: From the seismogram that you plotted above, define a window around the direct P-wave arrival. For this, give the window start and end time in the cell below (`window_start` and `window_end`).

Earthquakes don't send out sharp pulses -- their source-time functions are extended over time. This means that in reality, ray paths in the Earth do not exist either - instead our signals are sensitive to a blob of Earth that gets ever more complex depending on the Earth structure.\n\nInstead of seeing this as a limitation, **we can use the wave nature of seismic signals -- using waveform tomography**. Compared to 'classical' tomography, we do not measure specific arrival times and compare these to theoretically computed times, we compare entire seismograms against synthetic seismograms. In _waveform tomography_, we thus want to find an Earth model that fits our observed (entire) seismograms.\n\n![path](img/Waveform_tomography_cartoon.png)\n\nSensitivity kernels play a central role in achieving this.\n\n* By selecting windows that include arrivals that travelled along many different \"paths\" through the Earth, we can fill up our model with sensitivity. \n* Within each window, we compare our real and synthetic seismograms to each other to determine the \"misfit\", compute the adjoint source and from there calculate the sensitivity kernels.\n* Sensitivity kernels, in this context, are the _gradients_ of the misfit with respect to the model parameters. In other words, they tell you how each model parameter should be updated in order to better fit the data.\n* By doing this *iteratively* (compute misfit - compute gradients - update model - repeat), you can obtain an Earth model that reflects the full physics of seismic wave propagation, without needing any limiting assumptions.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Why bother with these simulations?\n\nThe simulations that you've run here are very slow. If you want do waveform tomography on a large scale, with potentially hundreds of thousands of seismograms from hundreds of earthquakes, this will consume a lot of computational resources (and as a consequence, result in not insignificant greenhouse gas emissions). We therefore want to be sure that it's worth it. So is it? \n\nYour final task is a back-of-the-envelope calculation on the width of the sensitivity kernel within the Earth. For this, you will consider a typical type of signal that seismologists observe on seismograms in the medium to long distance range. Typically, at those distances the observed signal frequency is in the order of 1 Hz max.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* **Question 15**: Have a look again at the sensitivity kernels that you created.

How do you expect the Fresnel zone/sensitivity kernel to change if we take into account the fact that seismic velocities within the Earth increase with depth? What does this mean for ray-based tomography?\n\n\n* **Question 16**: explain in your own words what kind of advantages it may have to use waveform tomography rather than (ray-based) traveltime tomography. In which context would travel-time tomography be more suitable? What kind of signals do you need, then?","metadata":{}}]}
